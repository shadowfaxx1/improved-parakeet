# ![Improved Parakeet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Improved%20Parakeet-Algorithm%20Analysis-blue)

Improved Parakeet is a project aimed at analyzing various sorting algorithms and their time complexity by implementing them on different numbers of objects. The project provides valuable insights into the performance of sorting algorithms and their efficiency for varying input sizes. The analysis includes popular sorting algorithms such as Quicksort, Mergesort, Insertion Sort, Heapsort, and Selection Sort.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Improved Parakeet implements different sorting algorithms to analyze their performance. This includes Quicksort, Mergesort, Insertion Sort, Heapsort, and Selection Sort. These algorithms are chosen for their different time complexities and approaches to sorting.

- **Time Complexity Analysis**: The project measures the execution time of each sorting algorithm for varying numbers of objects. It provides a graphical representation of the time taken to sort different input sizes, allowing users to observe the time complexity of each algorithm.

- **Multiple Programming Languages**: The project supports multiple programming languages such as Python, C, and C++. This allows users to compare the performance of sorting algorithms implemented in different languages and observe any variations in execution time.

## Usage

1. Clone the Improved Parakeet repository to your local machine.

2. Choose the programming language you want to use for the analysis (Python, C, or C++).

3. Navigate to the corresponding language folder in the repository.

4. Select the sorting algorithm you want to analyze.

5. Compile and run the code using the appropriate compiler or interpreter for the chosen language.

6. The program will automatically generate a graph showing the time taken to sort varying numbers of objects using the selected algorithm.

7. Analyze the graph to observe the time complexity of the sorting algorithm for different input sizes.

8. Repeat the steps for other sorting algorithms or programming languages to compare their performance.
